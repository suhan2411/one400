WordPress is the giant in the CMS world; the same is true for Instapage in the
landing page domain- now imagine the power you'll unleash when you combine
both these platforms together. With Instapage you get far more customization
options with your WordPress landing pages than a standalone plugin.

This is what we're offering you. We allow you to publish the conversion ready
landing pages you've built within Instapage to appear as a natural extension
of your WordPress blog or website. All you have to do is select the “Push to
WordPress” publishing option within Instapage when you're finished with your
landing page.
